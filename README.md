# Box office

## Overview

Progressive web app built from the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) PWA boilerplate, using the underlying webpack configuration.

The app allows users to search for TV shows or actors using the [Tvmaze api](https://www.tvmaze.com/api), mark their favorite shows, and view them on the /starred page. User preferences are saved using localStorage, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Technologies Used:

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to handle navigation
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/overview) library to fetch data
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), CSS-in-JS library
